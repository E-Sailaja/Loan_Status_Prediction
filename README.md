# Loan_Status_Prediction
This project demonstrates a binary classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the loan approval status. The model is trained on a cleaned version of a public loan dataset. This includes preprocessing, EDA, training/testing split, model building using SVM, and basic evaluation. 
# Loan Status Prediction using SVM

This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved or not using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features like applicant income, credit history, education, etc. We used Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for classification.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used contains details of loan applicants such as:
- Gender, Marital Status
- Education, Self-employment
- Income, Loan Amount
- Credit History, Property Area
- Loan Status (target variable)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Encoding categorical values
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Scaling
5. Model Training using SVM
6. Model Evaluation
7. Predictive System

## âœ… Accuracy
- Training Accuracy: ~79%
- Testing Accuracy: ~83%
