# Loan_Status_Prediction
This project demonstrates a binary classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the loan approval status. The model is trained on a cleaned version of a public loan dataset. This includes preprocessing, EDA, training/testing split, model building using SVM, and basic evaluation.
